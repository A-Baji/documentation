# DataJoint 101

Migrating from a unique system to a shared
[relational database](../ref-integrity/relational-databases) can be challenging, but 
there are a lot of materials to help you get started.

## Hands-on learning

First, it helps to see a data pipeline in action. DataJoint's Works platform
offers graphical user interfaces for our most common pipelines via 
[Elements](../../../elements/index.md). Many of the Elements also have Jupyter notebooks
you can run on your own machine, to start using Python or Matlab interfaces.
Follow along with the general [user instructions](../../../elements/user-guide)
to get started.

## Why data pipelines?

DataJoint is one way to define a comprehensive [data pipelines](./data-pipelines).
This is the full set of instructions that takes raw experimental data and
(a) formats it in an accessible, concepts-first manner, and (b) processes it
into publication-ready analyses. This will involve making some decisions about how
you want to organize your data before importing it into a pipeline, but a well-designed
pipeline can support and automate many projects and expedite the research process.

For more about the *why*, see the [DataJoint Mantra](../mantra).
