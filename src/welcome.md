The DataJoint ecosystem is divided into 2 distinct areas:

+ **Core**: Fully open-source projects built and designed specifically to support the [DataJoint Mantra](/concepts/mantra).

+ **Elements**: Fully open-source, data pipelines for neuroscience built with [DataJoint Core](/core).

## Feedback

DataJoint API's, DataJoint Web GUI's, and DataJoint Elements are supported by NIH grant U24 NS116470 for disseminating open-source software for neuroscience research. Your feedback is essential for continued funding. Your feedback also helps shape the technology development roadmap for the DataJoint ecosystem. Please tell us about your projects by filling out the [DataJoint Census](https://community.datajoint.io).
