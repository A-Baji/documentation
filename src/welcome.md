Welcome to the home for DataJoint documentation. Here we'll help get you to the right place quickly.

The DataJoint ecosystem is divided into 2 distinct areas:

<br>

**Core**: Fully open-source projects built and designed specifically to support the [DataJoint Mantra](../concepts/mantra/).

**Elements**: Fully open-source, domain-specific projects built with [DataJoint Core](../core). Currently, these are primarily focused on [Neuroscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience).
