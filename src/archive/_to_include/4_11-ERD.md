title: ERD
---

ERD stands for **entity relationship diagram**. Objects of type `dj.ERD`
allow visualizing portions of the data pipeline in graphical form.
Tables are depicted as nodes and `dependencies <dependencies>` as
directed edges between them. The <span class="title-ref">draw</span>
method plots the graph.

# Diagram notation

Consider the following ERD

![image](../_static/img/mp-erd.png)

DataJoint uses the following conventions:

-   Tables are indicated as nodes in the graph. The corresponding class
    name is indicated by each node.
-   `Data tiers <tiers>` are indicated as colors and symbols:
    Lookup=gray asterisk, Manual=green square, Imported=blue circle,
    Computed=red star, Part=black dot. The names of
    `part tables <master-part>` are indicated in a smaller font.
-   `dependencies` are indicated as edges in the graph and always
    directed downward, forming a **directed acyclic graph**.
-   Foreign keys contained within the primary key are indicated as solid
    lines. This means that the referenced table becomes part of the
    primary key of the dependent table.
-   Foreign keys that are outside the primary key are indicated by
    dashed lines.
-   If the primary key of the dependent table has no other attributes
    besides the foreign key, the foreign key is a thick solid line,
    indicating a 1:{0,1} relationship.
-   Foreign keys made without renaming the foreign key attributes are in
    black whereas foreign keys that rename the attributes are indicated
    in red.

# Diagramming an entire schema

=== "Python"

    {{BEGIN INDENT}}

    To plot the Diagram for an entire schema, an Diagram object can be
    initialized with the schema object (which is normally used to decorate
    table objects)

    ``` python
    import datajoint as dj
    schema = dj.Schema('my_database')
    dj.Diagram(schema).draw()
    ```

    or alternatively an object that has the schema object as an attribute,
    such as the module defining a schema:

    ``` python
    import datajoint as dj
    import seq    # import the sequence module defining the seq database
    dj.Diagram(seq).draw()   # draw the Diagram
    ```

    Note that calling the `.draw()` method is not necessary when working in
    a Jupyter notebook. You can simply let the object display itself, for
    example by entering `dj.Diagram(seq)` in a notebook cell. The Diagram
    will automatically render in the notebook by calling its `_repr_html_`
    method. A Diagram displayed without `.draw()` will be rendered as an
    SVG, and hovering the mouse over a table will reveal a compact version
    of the output of the `.describe()` method.

=== "Matlab"

    {{BEGIN INDENT}}

    The schema object for a package can be obtained using its `getSchema`
    function. (See `schema`.)

    ``` matlab
    draw(dj.ERD(seq.getSchema))   % draw the ERD
    ```

    DataJoint provides shortcuts to plot ERD of a table neighborhood or a
    schema using the `erd` command:

    ``` matlab
    % plot the ERD of the stimulus schema
    erd stimulus

    % plot the neighborhood of the stimulus.Trial table
    erd stimulus.Trial

    % plot the stimulus and experiment schemas and the neighborhood of preprocess.Sync
    erd stimulus experiment preprocess.Sync
    ```

    {{END INDENT}}

## Initializing with a single table

A <span class="title-ref">dj.ERD</span> object can be initialized with a
single table.

    === "Python"

    {{BEGIN INDENT}}

    ``` python
    dj.Diagram(seq.Genome).draw()
    ```

    {{END INDENT}}

=== "Matlab"

    {{BEGIN INDENT}}

    ``` matlab
    draw(dj.ERD(seq.Genome))
    ```

    {{END INDENT}}

A single node makes a rather boring graph but ERDs can be added together
or subtracted from each other using graph algebra.

## Adding ERDs together

However two graphs can be added, resulting in new graph containing the
union of the sets of nodes from the two original graphs. The
corresponding foreign keys will be automatically

=== "Python"

    {{BEGIN INDENT}}

    ``` python
    # plot the Diagram with tables Genome and Species from module seq.
    (dj.Diagram(seq.Genome) + dj.Diagram(seq.Species)).draw()
    ```

    {{END INDENT}}

=== "Matlab"

    {{BEGIN INDENT}}

    ``` matlab
    % plot the ERD with tables Genome and Species from package +seq.
    draw(dj.ERD(seq.Genome) + dj.ERD(seq.Species))
    ```

    {{END INDENT}}

## Expanding ERDs upstream and downstream

Adding a number to an ERD object adds nodes downstream in the pipeline
while subtracting a number from ERD object adds nodes upstream in the
pipeline.

Examples:

=== "Python"

    {{BEGIN INDENT}}

    ``` python
    # Plot all the tables directly downstream from ``seq.Genome``:
    (dj.Diagram(seq.Genome)+1).draw()
    ```

    ``` python
    # Plot all the tables directly upstream from ``seq.Genome``:
    (dj.Diagram(seq.Genome)-1).draw()
    ```

    ``` python
    # Plot the local neighborhood of ``seq.Genome``
    (dj.Diagram(seq.Genome)+1-1+1-1).draw()
    ```

    {{END INDENT}}

=== "Matlab"

    {{BEGIN INDENT}}

    ``` matlab
    % Plot all the tables directly downstream from ``seq.Genome``:
    draw(dj.ERD(seq.Genome)+1)
    ```

    ``` matlab
    % Plot all the tables directly upstream from ``seq.Genome``:
    draw(dj.ERD(seq.Genome)-1)
    ```

    ``` matlab
    % Plot the local neighborhood of ``seq.Genome``
    draw(dj.ERD(seq.Genome)+1-1+1-1)
    ```

    {{END INDENT}}
