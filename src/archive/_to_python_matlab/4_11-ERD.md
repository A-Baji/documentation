# Diagramming an entire schema

=== "Python"

    To plot the Diagram for an entire schema, an Diagram object can be
    initialized with the schema object (which is normally used to decorate
    table objects)

    ``` python
    import datajoint as dj
    schema = dj.Schema('my_database')
    dj.Diagram(schema).draw()
    ```

    or alternatively an object that has the schema object as an attribute,
    such as the module defining a schema:

    ``` python
    import datajoint as dj
    import seq    # import the sequence module defining the seq database
    dj.Diagram(seq).draw()   # draw the Diagram
    ```

    Note that calling the `.draw()` method is not necessary when working in
    a Jupyter notebook. You can simply let the object display itself, for
    example by entering `dj.Diagram(seq)` in a notebook cell. The Diagram
    will automatically render in the notebook by calling its `_repr_html_`
    method. A Diagram displayed without `.draw()` will be rendered as an
    SVG, and hovering the mouse over a table will reveal a compact version
    of the output of the `.describe()` method.

=== "Matlab"

    The schema object for a package can be obtained using its `getSchema`
    function. (See `schema`.)

    ``` matlab
    draw(dj.ERD(seq.getSchema))   % draw the ERD
    ```

    DataJoint provides shortcuts to plot ERD of a table neighborhood or a
    schema using the `erd` command:

    ``` matlab
    % plot the ERD of the stimulus schema
    erd stimulus

    % plot the neighborhood of the stimulus.Trial table
    erd stimulus.Trial

    % plot the stimulus and experiment schemas and the neighborhood of preprocess.Sync
    erd stimulus experiment preprocess.Sync
    ```

## Initializing with a single table

A <span class="title-ref">dj.ERD</span> object can be initialized with a
single table.

    === "Python"

    ``` python
    dj.Diagram(seq.Genome).draw()
    ```

=== "Matlab"

    ``` matlab
    draw(dj.ERD(seq.Genome))
    ```

A single node makes a rather boring graph but ERDs can be added together
or subtracted from each other using graph algebra.

## Adding ERDs together

However two graphs can be added, resulting in new graph containing the
union of the sets of nodes from the two original graphs. The
corresponding foreign keys will be automatically

=== "Python"

    ``` python
    # plot the Diagram with tables Genome and Species from module seq.
    (dj.Diagram(seq.Genome) + dj.Diagram(seq.Species)).draw()
    ```

=== "Matlab"

    ``` matlab
    % plot the ERD with tables Genome and Species from package +seq.
    draw(dj.ERD(seq.Genome) + dj.ERD(seq.Species))
    ```

## Expanding ERDs upstream and downstream

Adding a number to an ERD object adds nodes downstream in the pipeline
while subtracting a number from ERD object adds nodes upstream in the
pipeline.

Examples:

=== "Python"

    ``` python
    # Plot all the tables directly downstream from ``seq.Genome``:
    (dj.Diagram(seq.Genome)+1).draw()
    ```

    ``` python
    # Plot all the tables directly upstream from ``seq.Genome``:
    (dj.Diagram(seq.Genome)-1).draw()
    ```

    ``` python
    # Plot the local neighborhood of ``seq.Genome``
    (dj.Diagram(seq.Genome)+1-1+1-1).draw()
    ```

=== "Matlab"

    ``` matlab
    % Plot all the tables directly downstream from ``seq.Genome``:
    draw(dj.ERD(seq.Genome)+1)
    ```

    ``` matlab
    % Plot all the tables directly upstream from ``seq.Genome``:
    draw(dj.ERD(seq.Genome)-1)
    ```

    ``` matlab
    % Plot the local neighborhood of ``seq.Genome``
    draw(dj.ERD(seq.Genome)+1-1+1-1)
    ```
