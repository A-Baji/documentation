# Creating Schemas

# Schemas

On the database server, related tables are grouped into a named
collection called a **schema**. This grouping organizes the data and
allows control of user access. A database server may contain multiple
schemas each containing a subset of the tables. A single pipeline may
comprise multiple schemas. Tables are defined within a schema, so a
schema must be created before the creation of any tables.
