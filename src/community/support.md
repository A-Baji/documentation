# Support

We have a general policy for DataJoint open-source [community engagement](
    /community/contribution/#5-i-am-not-yet-too-comfortable-contributing-but-would-like-to-engage-the-community-what-is-the-policy-on-community-engagement).

+ General how-to or error question? Post on StackOverflow with the [`datajoint` tag](
     https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/datajoint)

+ Bug report or feature request? Submit a GitHub issue to the relevant repository

+ For open-ended discussions, join us on the [DataJoint Slack](
     https://join.slack.com/t/datajoint/shared_invite/enQtMjkwNjQxMjI5MDk0LWIzN2ExYzBiM2NlODQxN2YxODAxNWQwOWVkNjVmZDkzYzEwMjM5OWJkM2EwYTRhYmRiZDgxMjUzYjBlZWVjMzA)

+ DataJoint Office Hours
  + The DataJoint open source team will be offering monthly Office Hours.  These are
    public workshops on Zoom where we offer two half-hour sessions of free hands-on
    support to teams using DataJoint software.

  + For each half-hour session, a team can sign up to work through their specific
    question.  Teams who wish to receive this support can either share their workflow
    directly or work with DataJoint engineers to replicate the issue in a test
    environment.   To be fair to the community, no team will be selected for support
    more than once per quarter.

  + [Sign up for Office Hours!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeMhZtzQQWB47I8HfPcJ5_pFyMhZO284PLIblDfshe30dEuXw/viewform)
