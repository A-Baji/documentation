# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing! 🤝

To help keep everyone in alignment and coordinated in the community effort, we’ve created this document. It serves as the contribution guideline that outlines how open-source software development is to be conducted. Any software development that makes reference to this document can be assumed to adopt the policies outlined below. We’ve structured the guideline in a FAQ (frequently asked questions) format to make it easier to digest. Feel free to review the questions below to determine any specific policy.

The principal maintainer of DataJoint and associated tools is the DataJoin company. The pronouns “we” and “us” in this guideline refer to the principal maintainers. We invite reviews and contributions of the open-source software. We compiled these guidelines to make this work clear and efficient.
