# Dissemination Plan

## 1. Dissemination

We conduct activities to disseminate Resource components for adoption in diverse
neuroscience labs. These activities include

- A central [website](https://datajoint.com/docs/elements/) for the Resource.
- Conference talks, presentations, and workshops
- Publications in peer-reviewed journals
- White papers posted on internet resources and websites
- On-site workshops by invitation
- Remote workshops and webinars
- Online interactive tutorials hosted on [DataJoint CodeBook](https://codebook.datajoint.io).

## 1. Census

In order to measure the effectiveness of the Resource, we conduct several activities to
estimate the adoption and use of the Resource components:

- A citation mechanism for individual components of the Resource.

     | Resource | RRID |
     |:---------|:-----|
     | DataJoint | [RRID:SCR_014543](https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014543) |
     | DataJoint Elements | [RRID:SCR_021894](https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_021894) |

- Collect summary statistics of the number of downloads and repository forking.

- A register for self-reporting for component adoption and use (see [DataJoint Census](https://community.datajoint.io)).
