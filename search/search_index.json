Also the software configured for performing these steps. A typical workflow is composed of tables with inter-dependencies and processes to compute and insert data into the tables.   DataJoint a software framework for database programming directly from matlab and python. Thanks to its support of automated computational dependencies, DataJoint serves as a workflow management system.   DataJoint pipeline the data schemas and transformations underlying a DataJoint workflow. DataJoint allows defining code that specifies both the workflow and the data pipeline, and we have used the words \"pipeline\" and \"workflow\" almost interchangeably.   DataJoint schema a software module implementing a portion of an experiment workflow. Includes database table definitions, dependencies, and associated computations.

It serves as the contribution guideline that outlines how open-source software development is to be conducted. Any software development that makes reference to this document can be assumed to adopt the policies outlined below. We\u2019ve structured the guideline in a FAQ (frequently asked questions) format to make it easier to digest. Feel free to review the questions below to determine any specific policy.</p> <p>The principal maintainer of DataJoint and associated tools is the DataJoint company. The pronouns \u201cwe\u201d and \u201cus\u201d in this guideline refer to the principal maintainers. We invite reviews and contributions of the open-source software. We compiled these guidelines to make this work clear and efficient.</p>","location":"community/contribution/"},{"title":"1) Which issue should I contribute towards?","text":"<p>There are three primary things to consider when looking to contribute.</p> <p>Availability: An indication of whether anyone is currently working on a fix for the given issue. Availability is indicated by who is <code>assigned</code>. Issues that are <code>unassigned</code> mean that there is no one yet working on resolving the issue and the issue is available for someone to work on. If an issue has been assigned, then any additional work on that issue should be coordinated with the assignee.</p> <p>Specification: In order for issues to be properly addressed, the requirements of satisfying and closing the issue should be clear. If it is not, a label will be added as <code>unspecified</code>. This could be due to more debug info being necessary, more details on intended behavior, or perhaps that further discussion is required to determine a good solution. Feel free to help us arrive at a proper specification.</p> <p>Priority: As a community, we work on a concerted effort to bring about the realization of the milestones. We utilize milestones as a planning tool to help focus a group of changes around a release. To determine the priority of issues, simply have a look at the next milestone that is expected to arrive. Therefore, each milestone following this can be understood as lower in priority respectively. Bear in mind that much like a hurricane forecast, the execution plan is much more likely to be accurate the closer to today\u2019s date as opposed to milestones further out. Extremely low priority issues are assigned to the <code>Backburner</code> milestone. Since <code>Backburner</code> does not have a target date, this indicates that its issues may be deferred indefinitely. Occasionally the maintainers will move issues from <code>Backburner</code> as it makes sense to address them within a release. Also, issues <code>unassigned</code> to a milestone can be understood as new issues which have not been triaged.</p> <p>After considering the above, you may comment on the issue you\u2019d like to help fix and a maintainer will assign it to you.</p>","location":"community/contribution/#1-which-issue-should-i-contribute-towards"},{"title":"2) What is the proper etiquette for proposing changes as contribution?","text":"<p>What is generally expected from new contributions are the following:</p> <p>Any proposed contributor changes should be introduced in the form of a pull request (PR) from their fork.</p> <p>Proper branch target specified. The following are the generally the available branches that can be targeted:</p> <ul> <li><code>main</code> or <code>master</code>: Represents the single source of truth and the latest in completed development.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><code>pre</code>: Represents the source at the point of the last stable release.</li> </ul> <p>For larger more involved changes, a maintainer may determine it best to create a feature-specific branch and adjust the PR accordingly.</p> <p>A summary description that describes the overall intent behind the PR.</p> <p>Proper links to the issue(s) that the PR serves to resolve.</p> <p>Newly introduced changes must pass any required checks. Typically as it relates to tests, this means:</p> <ol> <li>No syntax errors</li> <li>No integration errors</li> <li>No style errors e.g. PEP8, etc.</li> <li>Similar or better code coverage</li> </ol> <p>Additional documentation to reflect new feature or behavior introduced.</p> <p>Necessary updates to the changelog following Keep a Changelog convention.</p> <p>A contributor should not approve or merge their own PR.</p> <p>Reviewer suggestions or feedback should not be directly committed to a branch on a contributor\u2019s fork. A less intrusive way to collaborate would be for the reviewer to PR to the contributor\u2019s fork/branch that is associated with the main PR currently in review.</p> <p>Maintainers will also ensure that PR\u2019s have the appropriate assignment for reviewer, milestone, and project.</p>","location":"community/contribution/#2-what-is-the-proper-etiquette-for-proposing-changes-as-contribution"},{"title":"3) How can I track the progress of an issue that has been assigned?","text":"<p>Since milestones represent the development plan, projects represent the actual execution.

Databases help to structure our daily lives which streamlines the time required to glean insights and build robust applications from truth. SQL is powerful but requires practice which we feel is the real fault in the language.</p> <p>To address this, the DataJoint query language serves as a query builder and optimizer for SQL. It leverages the stack's own operator precedence and combines it with both operator overloading and SQL algebra to achieve a more intuitive experience.

Drawing relationships between many entities we can create a DAG that describes a compute workflow as an entity-relationship model.</p> <p>For instance, an entity such as <code>Area</code> could represent the computed value of a parent entity, <code>Rectangle</code>.

The idea is that the larger the code base, the more there is to review and maintain. Therefore, we should aim to find a compromise where we can keep the code base from becoming too large without adding convoluted complexity.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Performance: Performance drawbacks should be avoided, controlled, or, at least, be properly monitored and justified.
